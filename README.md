# GilSDL - a really bad game engine no one should ever use.
I'm using this as a "learning" experience.
Most stuff is either poorly optimized, made, and/or not really useful.

Its based in SDL, however most functions shouldn't require you to actual touch any of it.
The main.cpp file contains an example of how to start the program. Basically make objects that inherit the Object class and make sure it has an override for the Update() function. 

SDL Libraries are managed using https://github.com/aminosbh/sdl2-cmake-modules.
